# A [river](https://github.com/ifreund/river)-status client

This client is useful if you want to have a workspace module for somethig like [eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) or [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar).

I also plan to add an option to display the title of the focused window.

### Dependencies
- rust

## Building

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/snakedye/ristate.git
cd ristate
cargo build --release
